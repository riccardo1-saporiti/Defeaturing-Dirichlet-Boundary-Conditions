# Defeaturing-Dirichlet-Boundary-Conditions
This repository contains the scripts used to reproduce the results in the report concerning the imposition of Dirichlet boundary data over the feature.
After having downloaded GeoPDEs 3.2.2, the folder "Test_Dirichlet_Feature" should be inserted in the geopdes's folder. The function addpath_geopdes.m, to be run each time at the beginning of the MATLAB session, might need to be modificated to suit the paths needed by the user.
